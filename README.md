## Build Process

LevelEditr uses [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to automate building, which 
requires [Node.js](http://node.js.org). The process is straightforward; see 
[Grunt's help page](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) for more info.

To build from scratch, install NodeJS, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
grunt
```
